/**
 * ======================
 *  Data Types
 * ======================
 */

/*
  PHP supports the following data types:
    - String
    - Integer
    - Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
    - Boolean
    - Array
    - Object
    - NULL
    - Resource
  */

/**
 * ============================
 *  Double or Single Quotes
 * ============================
 */

 /*
 1. Double quotes process or print with special characters, single quotes does not.

 Single Quotes (''):

 - Use them when you want to treat everything inside as plain text, even variables.
 - They're faster for PHP to process because it doesn't have to check for variables or special characters.

Double Quotes (""):

 - Use them when you want PHP to evaluate variables and special characters inside the string.
 - They're slower than single quotes but offer more flexibility in string manipulation.
