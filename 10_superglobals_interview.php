/*
 => Superglobals in PHP are predefined variables that are accessible from any part of a PHP script without needing to be explicitly declared. They are called "super" because they are available globally
 They include:
 - $_GET (Query strings in the URL)
 - $_POST (HTML Forms and js http request)
 - $_REQUEST (array containing data from $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE)
 - $_SESSION (used to store session data on the server)
 - $_COOKIE (a small piece of data stored on the client's computer)
 - $_SERVER (holds information about headers, paths, and script locations)
 - $_FILES (used to collect and handle file uploads submitted via an HTML form with the attribute enctype="multipart/form-data")
 - $_ENV (access to environment variables, these variables are set by the web server or the system)
